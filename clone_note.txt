I just created Empty Remote repository from GitHub.com account by clicking in the plus icon in top right corner and new repository and give a name and click create
And cloned this repository by clicking on Set up in Desktop and (Optionally select the ocation) click and clone
It cloned our remote repo to local so we can start working locally
